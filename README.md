# Gravity in Lobster

A toy project to simulate gravity (currently for Jupiter and its moons) in
Lobster. Similar to my [game of life implementation](https://github.com/blademaw/life),
this was largely to gain experience working with Lobster so I can potentially
use it for larger projects.

## Credit

The majority of this project is a port from Phillip Compeau's [Go implementation](https://compeau.cbd.cmu.edu/programming-for-lovers/chapter-4/)
into (hopefully semi-idiomatic) Lobster.
